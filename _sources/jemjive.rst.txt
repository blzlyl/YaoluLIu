JEMJIVE---a FEM toolkit
==============================
This documentation collects all the useful tools and skills I have learnt from my PhD project. Several aspects are covered, including C++ skills, computational tools and etc.



JEMJIVE
--------------------------------
The tutorial slides for JEMJIVE (jivepdf_) 

* The stress data used by the ViewModule is generated by the action "getTable"  
* The graph module uses the data generated by LoadDispModel

Explanation of the CustomShape class can found in shapepdf_.

General advices
++++++++++++++++++++++

* Do not fully trust some old codes in your group. They might be bug-free for certain type of problems but not for the others.
* Perform some basic tests for the codes you got from your group members. 


Cautions
++++++++++++++++++++++
* For each increment, the constraints you applied at the previous increment are not cleared by default! So for each increment, be sure you have applied the correct constraints!


The jemjive code is located in ``./src`` and consists of the following files:

::

  DelamMesh.[cpp|h]


**Phantom node cracking model**

``DelamMesh``
  Helper class for storing data defined in the ``LSPhantomNodeModel`` for usage in other models (in this case: the ``LagrTieModel``). Here, the node pairs are defined for which the Lagrange multiplier space is reduced.
