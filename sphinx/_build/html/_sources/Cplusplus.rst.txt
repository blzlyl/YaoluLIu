Project management
======================
This documentation collects all the useful tools and skills I have learnt from my PhD project. Several aspects are covered, including C++ skills, computational tools and etc.


Documentation tool: Sphinx
--------------------------------
A sample doc. tutorial with Sphinx can be found at https://matplotlib.org/sampledoc. A group tutorial_ on **How to organize project code** also has a nice chapter on Sphinx.


.. _tutorial: _static/project_code_management.pdf   

There is also an online documentation on Sphinx, the snapshot of which can be seen in Figure 1.

Profile C++ application
--------------------------------
How to profile C++ application with Callgrind / KCacheGrind:
https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2011/09/profile-c-application-with-callgrind-kcachegrind.html. With this program, the executation time of each part of a C++ application can be determined, which will be helpful in optimization of computational time.

The basic comands are:

* valgrind --tool=callgrind program [program_options]. For example, ``valgrind --tool=callgrind ../../src/fem-opt test.pro`` 


* kcachegrind callgrind.out.(id)
